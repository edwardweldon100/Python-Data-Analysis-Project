College Tuition, Diversity, & Pay
Python Data Analysis Project

Introduction:
My name is Ed and I am studying Data Science with Machine Learning at New York City Data Science Academy.

Data:
Kaggle: College tuition, diversity, and pay- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/college-tuition-diversity-and-pay?resource=download&select=tuition_cost.csv

Project:
Assessed how lucrative colleges are by comparing costs & salary potential for different schools of various types, states, sizes, and diversity.  Used Net Present Value to put all future college costs and career earnings in terms of today's dollars.
The Historical Tuition & Tuition Income files proved to be unusable and data for the other 3 files (Tuition Cost, Salary Potential, & Diversity School) needed to be cleaned extensively to complete the analysis. Duplicates & NULL needed to be removed, college names needed to be edited to merge different tables, state codes needed to be added to create unique College- State identifiers for each row.
Then % of Enrollment, Career Pay, College Cost functions needed to be added and then many different combinations of each table were merged to different plots.
